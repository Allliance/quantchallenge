# QuantChallenge Starter Repo

This is the starter repo to help you get started with QuantChallenge 2025.

## Sylvian Extension

Make sure you have installed the Sylvian extension and initialized it. **This is required to be eligible for prizes!**
1. Go to the command palette (⇧⌘P on Mac, Ctrl + Shift + P otherwise)
2. Search for 'Sylvian: Initialize Sylvian'
3. Enter the email you used for the competition

If done correctly, your .competition file should include `email=your_email_here`. **DO NOT EDIT THIS .competition FILE**!

## Directories

This repo consists of two folders: /research and /trading.

The `research` folder contains a IPython notebook `research_starter.ipynb` that helps you get started on the datasets and how to format predictions for submission.

The `trading` folder contains both a C++ and Python template for trading algorithm to be used in the live trading portion of QuantChallenge 2025. There is no advantage to using one or the other; you only need to choose one and develop an algorithm using that template.
